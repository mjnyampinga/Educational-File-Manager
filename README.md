## Connecting MongoDB with Postman

1. **MongoDB Connection**:
   - Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible from your application.
   - The connection string should be provided in the `.env` file as `MONGO_URI`.
   - This allows Postman requests to interact with the MongoDB database.

2. **Check Data**:
   - You can use MongoDB's shell or a GUI tool like **MongoDB Compass** to check if the data is correctly stored in your database after each API call.

---

## Conclusion

This guide covers how to interact with the API for user registration, login, file upload, and assignment submission. With Postman, you can easily test these endpoints and verify the functionality of your platform. The MongoDB integration ensures that all user data, files, and submissions are securely stored and managed.

Feel free to modify or extend the APIs based on your project’s needs! Let me know if you need any further clarification or modifications!

This **README.md** provides all the necessary details about the setup, API usage, and instructions to test the platform with Postman. Make sure to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username and adapt the MongoDB URI and JWT secret in your `.env` file.
